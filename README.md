# Rshiny-RNAseq
Final Project for BF591-- interactive Rshiny application displaying RNAseq analysis data

exploratory data set:  Transcriptional Reversion of Cardiac Myocyte Fate During Mammalian Cardiac Regeneration
  - This dataset profiled gene expression with RNASeq in murine cardiac tissue across different stages of development to identify genes associated with the loss of these cellâ€™s capacity to regenerate.

Included components:
Sample Information Exploration:
  - Tab with a summary of the table that includes a summary of the type and values in each column
  - Tab with a data table displaying the sample information, with sortable columns
  - Tab containing plots of continuous variables

Counts Matrix Exploration:
  - Tab with text or a table summarizing the effect of the filtering, including:
      - number of samples
      - total number of genes
      - number and percentage of genes passing current filter
      - number and percentage of genes not passing current filter
- Tab with diagnostic scatter plots, where genes passing filters are marked in a darker color, and genes filtered out are lighter:
    - median count vs variance (consider log scale for plot)
    - median count vs number of zeros
- Tab with a clustered heatmap of counts remaining after filtering
    - consider enabling log-transforming counts for visualization
- Tab with a scatter plot of principal component analysis projections. You may either:
    - allowing the user to select which principal components to plot in a scatter plot (e.g. PC1 vs PC2)
    - allowing the user to plot the top N principal components as a beeswarm plot

Differential Expression:
  - Tab with sortable table displaying differential expression results
  - Volcano Plot displaying DEGs and log2FoldChange

Visualization of Individual Gene Expression:
  - Content displaying a plot of the selected type with the normalized gene counts for the selected gene split out by the categorical variable chosen
